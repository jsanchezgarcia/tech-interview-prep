Data structures: you need to know how to implement them, pros and cons, time and memory complexities of operations.

 * Linked List (/and double ended linked list).
 * Dynamic array (/python list).
 * Stacks, queues, double ended queues.
 * Hash map (/python dictionary).
 * Binary tree.
 * Binary heap (/implemented as a list): have some idea about how to implement it, but mainly figure out how to use it (/for example, using minheap python library).
 * Binary Search Tree.
 * Prefix tree (/trie).

Algorithms:
 * [Binary search (implement it iteratively and recursively).](search/binary_search.py)
 * Sorting algorithms. (Mergesort, quicksort, bubblesort...).
 * Breadth-first search in a tree/graph.
 * Depth-first search in a tree/graph.
 * Tree traversals (pre-order, in-order, post-order).
 * [Topological sort of a graph.](/graphs/topo_sort.py)
 * Dijstra.
 * Dynamic programming.

Other:
 * [Understand and implement a LRU cache.](/caches/LRU.py)

* Object Oriented Programming:
  * Implement blackjack
  * Implement tic-tac-toe

Very common problems that you should dominate, just in case:
 * Verify if binary tree is a valid BST.
 * Verify if parenthesis/brackets are balanced.
 * [Edit distance between two words.](/dp/edit_distance.py)
 * [Trap water.](/dp/trap_water.py)
 * [Ways to make change.](/dp/ways-make-change.py)
 * Convert decimal to binary and back.
 * [Number of islands](/graphs/number_islands.py)
